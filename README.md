# Project Idia

A resource website for Twisted Wonderland, created with Next.js and Mantine.

## Important Notes

### Feedback

I have made a feedback form for issue/bug reports, suggestions, and comments [here](https://forms.gle/jFzi8xhwLmuFxnVP7).

### JP Server Content

So far, this website only contains content released in the **English** version of the game. I would like to add JP content eventually, but it is not a priority for me at the moment. I apologize if this is an inconvenience. However, I have been updating the super-deformed animation viewer with all the models from the JP version of the game.

### Data

Most of the data on this website is sourced from the [Twisted Wonderland Wiki](https://twistedwonderland.wiki.gg/), with a small portion from the game itself. All card assets were sourced from the game itself. If there are any data or asset inaccuracies, you can send them to me through the feedback form mentioned above.
